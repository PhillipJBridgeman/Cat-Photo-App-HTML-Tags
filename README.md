# Cat-Photo-App-HTML-Tags
This repository features my Cat Photo App project, where I practiced using HTML tags to structure web content. Through this project, I learned how to incorporate photos, buttons, and other elements into webpages, gaining valuable hands-on experience in web development. Explore the code to see how HTML tags bring webpages to life.
